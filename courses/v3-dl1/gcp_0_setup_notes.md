## GCP (Google Cloud Compute)
- fastai instructions for GCP: 
  - http://course-v3.fast.ai/start_gcp.html
- Console:  
  - https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances?project=near-earth-comets-f8c3f&folder&organizationId
- 

## Instance
```bash
gcloud --version
```
output:  
```bash
Google Cloud SDK 222.0.0
bq 2.0.36
core 2018.10.19
gsutil 4.34
```

## Create an Instance on GCP
```bash
% export IMAGE_FAMILY="pytorch-1-0-cu92-experimental"
% export ZONE="us-west2-b"
% export INSTANCE_NAME="my-fastai-instance"
% export INSTANCE_TYPE="n1-highmem-8"
% gcloud compute instances create $INSTANCE_NAME \
        --zone=$ZONE \
        --image-family=$IMAGE_FAMILY \
        --image-project=deeplearning-platform-release \
        --maintenance-policy=TERMINATE \
                --accelerator='type=nvidia-tesla-p4,count=1' \
        --machine-type=$INSTANCE_TYPE \
        --boot-disk-size=200GB \
        --metadata='install-nvidia-driver=True' \
        --preemptible
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/near-earth-comets-f8c3f/zones/us-west2-b/instances/my-fastai-instance].
NAME                ZONE        MACHINE_TYPE  PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP    STATUS

% 
```

## Go to GCP Console and see that the instance has been created
- https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances?project=near-earth-comets-f8c3f&folder&organizationId
- Note that this will be the page you have to go to later to **STOP YOUR INSTANCE**.

## Connect to GCP Instance
- Once this is done, you can connect to your instance from the terminal by typing:  
Example:  
```bash
gcloud compute ssh --zone=$ZONE jupyter@$INSTANCE_NAME -- -L 8080:localhost:8080
```
For me, it is:  
```bash
gcloud compute ssh --zone=$ZONE jupyter@my-fastai-instance -- -L 8080:localhost:8080
```
