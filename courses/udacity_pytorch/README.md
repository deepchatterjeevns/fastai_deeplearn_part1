## Course Outline
In this course, you'll learn the basics of deep neural networks and how to build various models using PyTorch. You'll get hands-on experience building state-of-the-art deep learning models.

### 1.  Introduction to Neural Networks
  - Learn the concepts behind deep learning and how we train deep neural networks with backpropagation.

### 2.  Talking PyTorch with Soumith Chintala
  - Cezanne Camacho and Soumith Chintala, the creator of PyTorch, chat about the past, present, and future of PyTorch.

### 3.  Introduction to PyTorch
  - Learn how to build deep neural networks with PyTorch
  - Build a state-of-the-art model using a pre-trained network that classifies cat and dog images

### 4.  Convolutional Neural Networks
  - Here you'll learn about convolutional neural networks, powerful architectures for solving computer vision problems.
  - Build and train an image classifier from scratch to classify dog breeds.

### 5.  Style Transfer
  - Use a trained network to transfer the style of one image to another image
  - Implement the style transfer model from Gatys et al.

### 6.  Recurrent Neural Networks
  - Learn how to use recurrent neural networks to learn from sequences of data such as time series
  - Build a recurrent network that learns from text and generates new text one character at a time

### 7.  Sentiment Prediction with an RNN
  - Build and train a recurrent network that can classify the sentiment of movie reviews

### 8.  Deploying PyTorch Models
  - Learn how to use PyTorch's Hybrid Frontend to convert models from Python to C++ for use in production
