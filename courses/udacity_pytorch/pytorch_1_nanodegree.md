# Lesson 1:  Welcome

## Phase 2: Deep Learning Nanodegree Scholarship Opportunity
You have the chance to qualify for a follow-up scholarship for a Nanodegree program. These scholarships will be awarded based on
- your progress and performance in the initial 2 month challenge course
- as well as your **contributions to the student community.**

So, be sure to:  
- cover all the concepts in the course
- complete all exercises along the way
- and help your fellow students by answering their questions in the forums or in Slack

## Participation

- We've created a Slack Workspace especially for this program so that you have the opportunity to interact with one another in a shared community. We encourage your to use Slack:  
- to ask questions and 
- receive technical help from your classmates and alumni volunteers
- participate in events and **attend AMA (Ask Me Anything)** sessions with the Scholarship Team.

## Developing an AI Application
After training and optimizing your model, you'll upload the saved network to one of our workspaces. Your model will receive a score based on its accuracy predicting flower species from a test set. This **score will be used in our decision process for awarding scholarships.**
